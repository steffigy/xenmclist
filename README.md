### What is this?
XenMC Whitelist is a script which lets your XenForo's members list, act as a whitelist for Minecraft.
People who are subsequently banned on your forums, also get de-whitelisted from the Minecraft server.

### Requirements
This is a MariaDB/MySQL based, PHP script. It's nothing fancy and it's pretty limited. But here's what
I am running the script on:

* Ubuntu (I guess Debian would work too?)
* MariaDB
* nginx & php5-fpm
* screen
* spigotMC server

### Minecraft Versions Supported
I've only tested this on Minecraft 1.8, using the spigotMC server project
